# Data Warehouse Initialization Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the steps required to initialize the data warehouse. The process involves creating a dedicated database and setting up three schemas—Bronze, Silver, and Gold—for handling data at different processing stages.

## Objectives

- **Database Creation:** Create a database named `datawarehouse`.
- **Schema Setup:** Within the database, create the following schemas:
  - **Bronze:** For raw, ingested data.
  - **Silver:** For cleaned and integrated data.
  - **Gold:** For curated data ready for analysis.
- **Verification:** Ensure that the database and all schemas are successfully created and operational.

## Steps to Initialize the Data Warehouse

### 1. Create the Database and its Schemas

- **Step 1:** Run the [00.sql](01_bronze_schema/00.sql) file.
- **Step 2:** Run the [01.sql](01_bronze_schema/01.sql) file to verify that everything has been created correctly.

## Post-Initialization Steps

After the initial setup, proceed with the following:

- **Data Ingestion:** Start loading raw data into the Bronze schema.
- **Data Transformation:** Apply cleaning and integration routines to move data from Bronze to Silver.
- **Data Curation:** Finalize data processing by populating the Gold schema.
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring and testing to ensure data flows correctly and integrity is maintained.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will establish a solid foundation for your data warehouse, providing a clear separation between raw data, processed data, and curated data. This layered approach supports scalable data management and prepares the system for further development and production workloads.
