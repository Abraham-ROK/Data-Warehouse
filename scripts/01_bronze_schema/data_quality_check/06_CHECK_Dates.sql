-- 6.1) Start Date > End Date
--- Expectation: No rows returned if dates are valid

SELECT 
    * ,
    CAST( --- Use CAST to change the DATETIME Type into DATE
    -- Window Function LEAD() OR LAG()
    LEAD(prd_start_dt) OVER (PARTITION BY prd_key ORDER BY prd_start_dt) - 1 AS DATE) AS new_prd_end_dt -- Calculate end date as one day before the next start date

-- 6.1) Convert INT into Dates

SELECT

sls_ship_dt,
sls_due_dt

    ---check if there "0" values in the dates
SELECT 
sls_order_dt,
sls_ship_dt,
sls_due_dt
FROM bronze.crm_sales_details
where sls_order_dt = 0 OR sls_order_dt < 0

  --- Option 1 use NULLIF()
SELECT 
NULLIF(sls_order_dt,0) AS sls_order_dt,
sls_ship_dt,
sls_due_dt
FROM bronze.crm_sales_details
where sls_order_dt = 0 OR sls_order_dt < 0

--- Option 2 use the query below 
SELECT 
CASE 
    WHEN sls_order_dt = 0 THEN NULL 
    WHEN sls_order_dt < 0 THEN NULL 
    ELSE sls_order_dt 
END AS sls_order_dt,

--- Solution to Convert INT into Dates

SELECT 
  CASE 
    -- If the date is 0 or if the casted string's length is deferent of 8 (unexpected), then return NULL
    WHEN sls_order_dt = 0 OR LEN(CAST(sls_order_dt AS VARCHAR(8))) != 8 THEN NULL
    ELSE CONVERT(date, RIGHT('00000000' + CAST(sls_order_dt AS VARCHAR(8)), 8)) --- '00000000' + '1012023'  -->  '000000001012023' --> '01012023'
  END AS sls_order_dt,
  sls_ship_dt,
  sls_due_dt
FROM bronze.crm_sales_details;

--- check if order_date > ship_date OR ship_date > due_date 
SELECT 
sls_order_dt,
sls_ship_dt,
sls_due_dt
FROM bronze.crm_sales_details
WHERE sls_order_dt > sls_ship_dt OR sls_ship_dt > sls_due_dt

-- Since some rows are counted in both conditions, you must account for overlap.
