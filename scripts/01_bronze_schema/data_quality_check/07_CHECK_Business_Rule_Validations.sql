--- Solution for this problem
-- RULES GO and talk to an expert

-- 1) If the Sales are Negative, Nulls, OR Zeros; Calculate it using sls_quantity and sls_price
-- 2) If sls_price are Nulls, OR Zeros; Calculate it using sls_quantity and sls_sales
-- 2) If sls_price are Negative; Convert it into Positive Value 

-- Common Table Expression (CTE) to be able to use the recalculated sales in the price calculation
